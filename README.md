HANDS an HTML And Node.js Development System 

An approach for web development  


In this project, a very compelling proposition is presented, an approach for web development that is a hybrid of Single Page Applications (SPA) and server side applications.  The proposed architecture provides a simplistic approach for development.  The focus is on HTML, JavaScript, Cascading Style Sheets, and Node.js.  

The architecture provides all the components required for students to start developing web applications and web services.  The HTML And Node.js Development System (HANDS) is a hybrid approach leveraging the simplicity of plain old HTML pages, the AJAX injection of HTML from SPA frameworks, and the server-side processing found in the Node.js framework.  The project includes a landing page, kitchen sink page (bootstrap html examples), and a simple REST service.

#####Installation Instructions

1) Download HENS from GitHub or use your Node.js environment/system.  HENS is a portable system for software development.  
[HENS](https://github.com/ChipSoftTech/HENS).

2) Download HANDS zip file
[HANDS](https://github.com/ChipSoftTech/HANDS/archive/master.zip).

3) Unzip to local drive or USB

4) Using HENS, run the following command to start the HANDS App:

```bash
 node app.js
 ```
 
 5)  Using your browser, navigate to the landing page:
 ```bash
 http://localhost:8080/
 ```
 
 6)  Using your browser, navigate to the kitchen sink page:
 ```bash
 http://localhost:8080/kitchen-sink
 ```
 
 7)  Using your browser, navigate to to REST service example: 
  ```bash
 http://localhost:8080/api/v1/teams
 ```

#####Thoughts
Frameworks are not "silver bullets". When you program against a Framework, youâ€™re allowing someone else to take control of the big decisions about the code for you. Surely you can see that? These big decisions once made are very hard to retrace upon, if the framework is too encompassing then it will make all the major decisions for you. Using frameworks also obfuscate the actual programming away. Define your interpretation of a framework, there is more than one type of framework. Some frameworks are so integrated to the programming language then I would call these programming systems.  Depending on your context, and you would like to use a framework, take some time up front and find a framework that works for your team.  I too have made some decisions in this starter kit that you may want to use or change.

If you can program the code yourself and most importantly understand the code, and the code can be developed in a reasonable amount of time, why would you use a third party tool? When bugs appear, you understand how things work and can track down the root problem. I am an engineer, I build code that sometimes breaks but shouldn't collapses. 

Some thoughts.  My goal is to keep close html, js, and node.js.  Go ahead and contribute or fork - add code or packages that meet your needs.  Go ahead and add issues too.  Enjoy the Code!  Brian.
